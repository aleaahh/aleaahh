Hi, I'm Alya! 👋
I'm a CS student with a keen interest in UI/UX and data. Currently, I'm learning Python and always looking for new ways to improve my skills.

🔍 If you have any great resources for learning data science or other programming languages, feel free to share! Sometimes, learning to code feels like navigating a dense forest—so any guidance is always appreciated. 😄

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
